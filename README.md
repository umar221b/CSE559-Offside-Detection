This code is forked from [this repo](https://github.com/surajkra/Vision-Based-Dynamic-Offside-Line-Marker-for-Soccer-Games).
Some functions from [here](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/28512-simplecolordetectionbyhue?s_tid=srchtitle) are added.

The code has been modified by myself for CSE559 at Washington University in St. Louis, Fall 2020.
